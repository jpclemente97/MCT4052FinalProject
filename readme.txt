To run this system, you must first run the TestAndTrainANNs.ipynb jupyter notebook. This notebook will train the classifier and the regressor for each drummer. The outputs will include joblib file for the MLP classifier pipeline, as well as microtiming and velocity CSVs for drummer 3, 7, and 9, since these were the drummers that were found to produce the most consistent results. 

After this, the python file midi.py must be run. This file will produce 100 MIDI files with constant 16th notes for hi-hat, snare, and bass drum using the microtiming and velocity CSVs generated from the previous section. You must enter the number of the drummer you wish to generate MIDI files for in order to run this program (ex. 3, 7, or 9).

Finally, the jupyter notebook AnalyzeGeneratedFiles.ipynb must be run. This will take the MIDI files generated from midi.py and test them against the previously trained MLP classifier. The joblib file must be in the same directory as this jupyter notebook, as well as the MIDI files under a folder titled "generatedGroove" (this will be generated by midi.py). The end output will be an accuracy score along with a confusion matrix.

Both of the .ipynb files need classes.py, which contains the MIDI file classes, and functions.py, which contains a common function, in the same folder in order to operate.
